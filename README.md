An online password generator is a project that aims to provide users with a secure and convenient way to generate strong passwords. The project typically involves developing a web application that can generate passwords using a variety of criteria, such as length, complexity, and character sets. The application may also include additional features, such as the ability to save generated passwords securely, or to check the strength of existing passwords. The goal of this project is to create a tool that can help users protect their online accounts and personal information from unauthorized access.
